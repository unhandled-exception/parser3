# AC_LIBLTDL_CONVENIENCE[(dir)] - sets LIBLTDL to the link flags for
# the libltdl convenience library and INCLTDL to the include flags for
# the libltdl header and adds --enable-ltdl-convenience to the
# configure arguments.  Note that LIBLTDL and INCLTDL are not
# AC_SUBSTed, nor is AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS called.  If DIR is not
# provided, it is assumed to be `libltdl'.  LIBLTDL will be prefixed
# with '${top_builddir}/' and INCLTDL will be prefixed with
# '${top_srcdir}/' (note the single quotes!).  If your package is not
# flat and you're not using automake, define top_builddir and
# top_srcdir appropriately in the Makefiles.
